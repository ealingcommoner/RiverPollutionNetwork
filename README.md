# RiverPollutionNetwork
Building a low-cost community pollution detector for our local river

*Work in Progress*

##Background to project
The River Brent in West London is a little river which runs through a mix of urban industrial areas and the huge Brent River Park in Hanwell.

Every few months we see pollution incidents from a range of causes:
- Deliberate dumping of pollutants
- Storm drains
- Badly connected outlets

These cause damage to the wildlife, particularly the many fish and eels which live in the River. 
We have formed a group which keeps an eye on the River and report pollution incidents so the Environment Agency can send a team to investigate and mitigate the damage. 

But we're a small group and it can take hours or days to notice a problem. 

## Aims
Use low-cost, remotely deployed sensors to alert the community to a pollution incident. 

## Measurement
Having reviewed pollution incident reports, it appears the most common indicators are:
- Total Dissolved Oxygen (TDO)
- Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)

TDO sensors are around £130 each, whilst [this TDS sensor](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1662.html is £11. We could consider adding TDO in future if funding permits, but for now it seems TDS gives us the best effect for our money.
